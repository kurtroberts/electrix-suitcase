#Electrix Suitcase

I decided to mount a bunch of Electrix gear in a surplus military shipping case.  This git repo contains all the digital assets I needed, plus my notes.


##Prerequisite Hardware
- [The Suitcase](http://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/used-us-military-surplus-fiberglass-shipping-case?a=1812411) 
- [Rack Rails (it will support an 8u rack)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JQYUEA2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [JB Weld](http://www.amazon.com/J-B-Weld-8265S-Original-Reinforced/dp/B0006O1ICE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442610905&sr=8-1&keywords=jb+weld)

That would be where I probably should have stopped.  But of course most of what's in this repo is where the crazy actually went, creating a customized patch panel for the repeater, mofx and filterfactory, as well as a custom power system.

I mean, I used to make this stuff for a living, for the biggest touring company in the world.  Of course it went too far.
