#Electrix Suitcase

I decided to mount a bunch of Electrix gear in a surplus military shipping case.  This git repo contains all the digital assets I needed, plus my notes.


##Prerequisite Hardware
- [The Suitcase](http://www.sportsmansguide.com/product/index/used-us-military-surplus-fiberglass-shipping-case?a=1812411) 
- [Rack Rails (it will support an 8u rack)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JQYUEA2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- [JB Weld](http://www.amazon.com/J-B-Weld-8265S-Original-Reinforced/dp/B0006O1ICE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1442610905&sr=8-1&keywords=jb+weld)

That would be where I probably should have stopped.  But of course most of what's in this repo is where the crazy actually went, creating a customized patch panel for the repeater, mofx and filterfactory, as well as a custom power system.

I mean, I used to make this stuff for a living, for the biggest touring company in the world.  Of course it went too far.

##Mechanical Issues
I'm 90% certain that 3mm bamboo is going to be too weak for this much jack force.  Unfortunately, that's as thick of a material as I can go and still have the jacks screw through correctly.  The bamboo seems to have more give than acrylic, which I'm positive will just crack immediately.

I'd prefer alumninum - or steel for that matter.  The case weighs a ton already.

All of that aside, my other thoughts would be to use a thicker material, reduce the hole size and tap the material itself - maybe delrin (ugly though); support the material with some kind of metal backing braces; reduce the jacks to 3.5mm unbalanced instead of 6.3mm balanced; or re-think the panels individually, using something like eurorack rails to mount them so that the panel material isn't load bearing.

With the exception of smaller jacks, I have to do all the soldering anyway, so I'm going to do one of these in bamboo.  Regardless, it will look nice and make nice portfolio pics. ;)
